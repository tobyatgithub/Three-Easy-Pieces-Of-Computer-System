## Reading Notes

### Chapter 2 intro

Key/Crux of this chapter:

Crux of Virtualization:

> How does the operating system virtualize resources? where **virtualization** == the OS takes a physical resource (processor, memory, or a disk) and transforms it into a more general, powerful, and easy-to-use virtual form of itself.

- provides some interfaces/APIs/system calls that are available to applications (standard library).
- thus OS is known as a resource manager.
- Memory virtualization: each process accesses its own private virtual address space (sometimes just called its address space), which the OS somehow maps onto the physical memory of the machine.

Crux of "How to build correct concurrent programs":

> When there are many concurrently executing threads within the same memory space, how can we build a correctly working program? What primitives are needed from the OS? What mechanisms should be provided by the hardware? How can we use them to solve the problems of concurrency?

Crux of the "how to store data persistently":

> The file system is the part of the OS in charge of managing persistent data. What techniques are needed to do so correctly? What mechanisms and policies are required to do so with high performance? How is reliability achieved, in the face of failures in hardware and software?

### Chapter 4 CPU-Intro, The Abstraction: The Process

The process == a running program. (where a program is a lifeless bunch of instructions and maybe some static data on the disk, waiting to spring into action.)

The Crux of "How to provide the illusion of many CPUs"?

> Although there are only a few physical CPUs available, how can the OS provide the illusion of a nearly-endless supply of said CPUs?

- The OS creates this illusion by virtualizing the CPU. By running one process, then stopping it and running another, and so forth, the OS can promote the illusion that many virtual CPUs exist when in fact there is only one physical CPU (or a few)

- time sharing: is a basic technique used by an OS to share a resource. By allowing the resource to be used for a little while by one entity, and then a little while by another, and so forth, the resource in question (e.g., the CPU, or a network link) can be shared by many. This basic technique, known as time sharing of the CPU, allows users to run as many concurrent processes as they would like; the potential cost is performance, as each will run more slowly if the CPU(s) must be shared.

- mechanism: We call the low-level machinery mechanisms; mechanisms are low-level methods or protocols that implement a needed piece of functionality.

- policy: Policies are algorithms for making some kind of decision within the OS. For example, given a number of possible programs to run on a CPU, which program should the OS run?

- 5 must-have process APIs: create, destroy, wait, miscellaneous control, status.

- 3 process states: running, ready, and blocked

### Chapter 5 Interlude: Process API

- The CPU scheduler (via calling fork()), we can see, is not deterministic. (i.e. the parent process and child process from fork() might get called and executed in any order.)

- This non-determinism, as it turns out, leads to some interesting problems, particularly in multi-threaded programs; hence, weâ€™ll see a lot more non- determinism when we study concurrency in the second part of the book.

- The strangeness of `fork()` and `exec()` (and `wait()`). For now, suffice it to say that the `fork()`/`exec()` combination is a powerful way to create and manipulate processes.

- The `wait()` system call allows a parent to wait for its child to complete execution.

- The `exec()` family of system calls allows a child to break free from its similarity to its parent and execute an entirely new program.

- A UNIX shell commonly uses fork(), wait(), and exec() to launch user commands; the separation of fork and exec enables features like input/output redirection, pipes, and other cool features, all without changing anything about the programs being run.

- Process control other than fork and exec (e.g. kill) can be used to send signals to a process. However, not everyone/application is allowed to do this. Otherwise the usability and security of the system will be compromised. Thus only a validated **user** is allowed to control their own processes.

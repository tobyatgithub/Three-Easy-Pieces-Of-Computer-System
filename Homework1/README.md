# Homework 1

## Question 1:

> Run process-run.py with the following flags: -l 5:100,5:100. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the -c and -p flags to see if you were right.

**Answer**:

The CPU will run the two jobs in sequence (i.e. run job1, wait until finished, and then run job2.)

And the CPU utilization shall be 100% as here we only run CPU jobs (as both job use "5:100" flag which indicates 100% cpu job.)

Result of `./process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100 -c -p`:

```
Stats: Total Time 10
Stats: CPU Busy 10 (100.00%)
Stats: IO Busy  0 (0.00%)
```

## Question 2:

> Now run with these flags: ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes? Use -c and -p to find out if you were right.

**Answer**:

It shall take 4 clock time to complete job1, and 2 clock time to complete job 2 (run io and run io_done) assuming i/o initiation and completion only takes 1 clock time for simplicity.
-> well... correction: it turns out that the `-L` is 5 by default if not specified (which means any I/O job will at least take 5 clock time + initiation + completion). Thus the total time used is 4 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 11

Result of `./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0 -c -p`:

```

## Question 3:

> Switch the order of the processes: -l 1:0,4:100. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why? (As always, use -c and -p to see if you were right)

**Answer**:

It matters! The reason being that if we run the I/O task (1:0) first, we will be able to run the second non-I/O job (4:100) while the cpu is waiting for the first I/O job. Thus saving a lot of times and efficiency.

Result of `./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -p`:

## Question 4

> Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is -S, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to SWITCH ON END, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?

**Answer**:
As we see from question 3, the switching helped a lot compared to question 2. If we ban the switch here, we will just get the same result from question s. As confirmed by running the `./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END -p -c`:

```

## Question 5

> Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O (-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO). What happens now? Use -c and -p to confirm that you are right.

**Answer**:

We shall get the same result from question 3, the cpu will switch to another task when waiting on the I/O to finish.

## Question 6

> One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With -I IO_RUN_LATER, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (Run ./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER -c -p) Are system resources being effectively utilized?

**Answer**:
As described in the `-I` flag:

- the I/O job (3:0) will run first
- while cpu waiting on the I/O job to finish, it will kick start the cpu job (5:100)
- since the `-I` is set to io run later, the I/O job will wait until the cpu job finishes to run the io_done
- however (??), it turns out that the io job will keep waiting until all cpu jobs (there are three 5:100 cpu jobs) to finish to resume.

Result from `./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER -c -p`

## Question7

> Now run the same processes, but with -I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?

**Answer**:

The behavior will be much different! The I/O init and completion will now kick in immediately. This is very beneficial as:
1 - it will greatly improve the cpu stats and io stats (much higher efficiency) because we are utilizing the cpu while waiting on the I/O for as many I/O tasks as possible. (Different from question 6 where only the first I/O task gets to take this advantage.)
2 - the I/O task might update some files in hardware and might influence the result of the cpu job. Thus finish that I/O job earlier could make the cpu task result more accurate.
